# amex_AnalyzeThis2019
A problem statement given by American Express in their flagship event - Analyze This 2019 conducted across major IITs and Analytics campuses in India (A participation of over 1000+ students). The problem statement consisted of a dataset of their clients with 20 Explanatory variables and one Response Variable. We had to assign a credit line (Low/Medium/High) for any given new customer based on his/her financial records kept with the bank. Our solution, which got a leaderboard rank under 50, consisted of heavy feature engineering and ensembling model to capture the pattern in data.
